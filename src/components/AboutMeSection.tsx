                                My journey with technology is one of continuous learning, practical application, and a genuine passion for building things that work.
                                After an initial period in the IT industry, my path took a different turn for a few years, but my fascination with coding and system building never faded.

                                More recently, I've dived back into my technical passions headfirst, focusing on MERN stack development and the fascinating world of DevOps and self-hosting.
                                This isn't just theoretical for me; I've built and continue to expand my own homelab server environment from the ground up.
                                There's immense satisfaction in this â€“ like setting up a media server that allows a friend overseas to access our favorite TV shows, or providing a personal 1TB cloud storage solution for my brother.
                                These personal projects are where I rigorously hone my skills with Docker, Linux administration, and network configuration.

                                This hands-on, problem-solving approach is what I bring to my freelance work. I'm committed to leveraging these modern skills to create valuable, efficient, and reliable web solutions for my clients.
